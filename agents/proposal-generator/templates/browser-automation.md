I built a Playwright bot that logs into a protected portal, navigates through dynamic pages, and extracts structured data automatically — same kind of challenge you're describing.

For this project I'd use [TOOL: Playwright or Selenium] to [DESCRIBE APPROACH IN 1-2 LINES], handling login, dynamic content, and any anti-bot measures that come up.

A couple of quick questions:
- Does the site require login or CAPTCHA?
- Should the bot run on a schedule or on-demand?

Happy to run a quick proof-of-concept on one page so you can see it working before we scope the full thing.
