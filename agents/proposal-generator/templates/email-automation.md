I recently built an automation that scrapes structured data from a live website and triggers automated emails — same stack you need here (Python, BeautifulSoup, smtplib).

My approach for this project:
1. Scrape [SOURCE] extracting only records with valid email addresses
2. Deduplicate and clean the list
3. Build the send script with personalization support and error handling

What's the website URL? I'll confirm the approach and give you an accurate timeline after a quick look.
