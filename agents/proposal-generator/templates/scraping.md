I scraped 500+ structured records from vlr.gg and built an automated digest around it — same approach applies here.

For this project I'd use Python + BeautifulSoup to extract [FIELDS], handle pagination, deduplicate the output, and deliver a clean Excel/CSV file ready to use.

A few quick questions:
- One-time export or recurring/scheduled run?
- Any login or authentication required to access the data?

Happy to do a test run on 10–20 records first so you can verify the output before we go full scale.

I also built an automated pipeline that processes data end-to-end without manual intervention — same principle here.
